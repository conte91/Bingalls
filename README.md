# Bingalls - aka download Bing's wallpapers everyday #

This tiny script (scaricamilosfondodioggidibing.sh) will help you download all the Bing's wallpapers every day.

When launched, it will download all the wallpapers that were added on Bing since the last time you run it. 

Note that the maximum time period over which it will download *everything* is 20 days, as this is the time frame that Bing mantains.

## Usage ##
Simply launch scaricamilosfondodioggidibing.sh .

The default directory in which wallpapers are downloaded can be set inside the script.

If launched with a parameter, scaricamilosfondodioggidibing.sh will download regional wallpapers instead of the international ones (e.g. try scaricamilosfondodioggidibing.sh gb)


Hint: add this script to a daily cron job in order not to lose anything :)
